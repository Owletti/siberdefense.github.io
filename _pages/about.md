title: "What is Siber Defense Club?"
---

Siber (Cyber) Defense is an Associated Student Body club at Mount Si High School
in Snoqualmie, WA. The club discusses, uses, and shares the principles of
technology and information security. Together we explore various ways that
technology and the people who use it are vulnerable and how to protect against
malicious activity.

Cyber security is an increasingly important field in todayâ€™s environment, and we
seek to explore the opportunities that it presents, defend ourselves, families,
and friends against malicious attacks, and even learn about the lucrative fun
careers in information security.

The Siber Defense Club participates in various activities and competitions
throughout the year. We also go on special field trips, build computer networks,
compete in in-club cyber games, learn teamwork collaboration, and more.
