**All MSHS students!**

Attendance is free and always open.

No experience required, but a little programming practice helps a lot. Come
willing to learn and consider enrolling in the one of the various Computer
Science courses available at MSHS to supercharge your security skills.

Bring your laptop! Most exercises work with district-provided devices, but
sometimes having your own device is helpful to experiment with new software
tools.

## What

**Solve hands on information security challenges.**

A typical meeting starts with a topic introduction and then students dive into a
challenge with instructors there to help.

We encourage students to work together and help each other.
