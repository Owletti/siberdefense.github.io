# Siber Defense Club

## What is  Siber Defense Club at Mount Si High School?

Siber (Cyber) Defense is an Associated Student Body club at Mount Si High School (Snoqualmie, WA) that discusses, uses, and shares the principles of technology and information security. Together, we explore various ways that technology and the people who use it are vulnerable and how to protect against malicious activity.

Cyber security is an increasingly important field in today's environment, and we seek to explore the opportunities that it presents, defend ourselves, families, and friends against malicious attacks, and even learn about the lucrative fun careers in information security.

The Siber Defense Club participates in various activities and competitions throughout the year like CyberPatriot Competition, National Cyber League Fall & Spring Seasons, CyberStart America, Pacific Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, and various other Capture-the-Flag competitions, competing against other high schools in Washington, USA, and international.  We also go on special field trips, build computer networks, compete in in-club cyber games, learn teamwork collaboration, and more.
