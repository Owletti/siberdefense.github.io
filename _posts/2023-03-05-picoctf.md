The [2023 PicoCTF
competition](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2023-spring.html) runs from 14-28
March.

The club will field one 5-person team in the high school category this year.

We'll use our regularly scheduled meeting on Wednesday 15 March to compete. We
will also have a
special weekend session from 10AM to 4PM on Sunday 19 March. Coach B will give
location details to the team members via Discord. Parents are always welcome!

As usual, the competition includes topics such as Forensics, Reverse
Engineering, Binary Exploitation, Cryptography and Web Exploitation.
