The [2023 PicoCTF
competition](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2023-spring.html) runs
continuously from 14-28 March.

This Jeopardy-style competition is open to participants from around the world
and includes challenges of varying difficulty in topics including Forensics,
Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation, Cryptography and Web Exploitation.

This year the club will field one 5-person team to compete in the high school
category.

We'll use our regularly scheduled meeting on Wednesday 15 March to compete as a
club.

We will also have a extra weekend session on Sunday 19 March from 10AM to 4PM.
Coach B will give location details to the team members via Discord. Parents are
always welcome!
