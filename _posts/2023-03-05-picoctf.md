The [2023 PicoCTF
competition](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2023-spring.html) runs
continuously from 14-28 March. This year the club will field one 5-person team
to compete in the high school category.

We'll use our regularly scheduled meeting on Wednesday 15 March to compete as a
club. We will also have a extra weekend session on Sunday 19 March from 10AM to
4PM. Coach B will give location details to the team members at the 15 March
meeting and on Discord. Parents are always welcome!
