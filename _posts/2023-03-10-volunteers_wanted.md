Are you a cyber security professional with a connection to Mount Si High School? We want to hear from you! We create a positive learning environment to introduce motivated high schoolers to our profession and we need your help. 

We'd love to meet more often than every other week, but we don't have the instructors to do it. We've all got day jobs and life happens, so you don't have to make every session. The more help we have the better experience we can give to a wider variety of students. All skill disciplines and skill fields are welcome. Everyone in the field has something valuable to add.
